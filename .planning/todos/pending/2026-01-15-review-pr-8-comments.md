## Problem

The user requested a review of comments on Pull Request #8: https://github.com/NaikDeepak/village-mandi/pull/8

We need to analyze these comments to determine if they require code changes or if they are invalid. This is a blocking step before merging or proceeding with further development.

## Solution

1. Retrieve comments from the PR URL (using gh cli if available or asking user for content).
2. For each comment:
   - Check the relevant code.
   - Determine if the comment points out a valid bug, improvement, or style issue.
   - If valid, outline the fix.
   - If invalid, document the reasoning.
3. Create a plan (e.g., a new phase or todo items) to address the valid feedback.
