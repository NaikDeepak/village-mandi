# Plan 12-01: Buyer Dashboard & Order History

## Objective
Implement a user-friendly dashboard for buyers to track their current order status and view historical orders.

## Tasks

### 1. Frontend API & Types
- [ ] Verify `Order` type in `web/src/types/index.ts` includes `payments` and detailed `items`. (Already largely present, but might need refinement for buyer view).
- [ ] Ensure `ordersApi.getMyOrders()` is correctly used in the dashboard.

### 2. UI Components
- [ ] Create `web/src/components/buyer/OrderStatusBar.tsx`:
  - Visual progress bar for order stages: Placed -> Paid -> Packed -> Ready for Pickup/Distributed.
- [ ] Create `web/src/components/buyer/OrderCard.tsx`:
  - Detailed view of an order including items, total, and payment summary.

### 3. Pages
- [ ] Update `web/src/pages/BuyerDashboardPage.tsx`:
  - Split view: "Active Order" (if any) and "Order History".
  - Empty state when no orders exist.
  - Loading and error states.

### 4. Navigation & UX
- [ ] Ensure the "Dashboard" link in the buyer's header (if exists) or post-login redirect leads here.
- [ ] Add a link to the Shop page if no active order exists.

## Verification
- [ ] Manual verification of the buyer dashboard with mock/real orders.
- [ ] Verify responsive layout on mobile (primary use case for buyers).
- [ ] Ensure no regressions in Admin order views.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Buyer can see their current order's status clearly.
- [ ] Buyer can see their payment status (Amount Paid vs Total).
- [ ] Buyer can view a list of all past orders.
